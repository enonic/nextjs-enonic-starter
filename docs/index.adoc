[NOTE]
====
This guide assumes you are already somewhat familiar with link:https://nextjs.org/[Next.js]. Experience with Enonic is recommended, but not required. 

To learn more about Next.js and Enonic before you start, have a look at these tutorials:

- link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/headless-cms/[Headless CMS Primer]
====

== Introduction

In this tutorial we will demonstrate a close integration between the systems, where the structure and content in the CMS determines the URLs and content available in the front-end. 
This is possible as Enonic (unlike many other Headless CMS') supports tree-structures.

The integration also give editors a CMS experience they are accustomed to, while developers can work with their front-end code, cleanly separated from the CMS. 
The headless architecture of Enonic ensures the content can be accessed and used by other clients as well - naturally.

== Overview

You will complete the following steps:

* Setup Enonic SDK and content via template
* Run queries against the Headless API
* Create a Next.js app using a template 
* Setting up preview in Enonic
* Rendering content based on types
* Using components to build landing pages
* Setting up page templates
* Deploying to live servers

== TLDR;

The impatient may try out end-result of this tutorial (and get a fully working demo) - following these instructions: If you want to learn what is really happening, head on to the <<enonic-setup#, first chapter>> of the tutorial.

=== 1. Setup Enonic

. Sign up to Enonic Cloud: https://enonic.com/sign-up/cloud-trial
. Create a new solution using the `Next.js demo` template
. After the solution has started, **open the "Drafts" route** in your browser
+
By adding `/_graphql` to the end of the browser URL, you should be able to browse the API. 
Take a note of the full API URL, as you will need it later

=== 2. Create code repo

NOTE: Vercel (Next.js hosting provider) requires that you place your code in a repo where you have write access.

. Create a fork or clone of this repo: https://github.com/enonic/nextjs-enonic-demo
+
If you are using Github, click `fork` in the top right menu, and select the target account.
+
You should now have your own copy of this repo, with both read and write access.


=== 3. Deploy on Vercel

. Sign up to https://vercel.com/ 
. Create a new project based on the repo you created in the previous step 
. Give it a suitable name, e.g. "Enonic Preview"
. **Add environment variables* linking the project to the "Drafts API"
+
It should look something like this:
+
KEY:: `CONTENT_API_URL`
VALUE:: `https://myaccount-mysolution-myenvironment/drafts/_graphql`
+
. Deploy, and verify that the Next app is now rendering correctly.

=== 4. Configure preview

For Content Studio preview to work, it needs to know the location of the preview server.

. **Add environment configuration** to by editing the "Next.js Demo" app that was installed when setting up the solution:
+
The configuration should look something like this:
+

+
. **Launch Enonic XP admin** and go to Content Studio. Select a content item, and you should now be able to see the preview in the right hand panel.
+

=== 5. Go live

Your final step is to launch a Vercel project that renders the published (aka live) content.

. **Create a new "Live" project in Vercel**, using the same Github repo as created earlier
. This time, **Configure the project** to access the "Live API" instead, same approach as for the preview project.
+
When visiting the "Live" server, it should initially display a 404 page. This is because the site and content has not been published yet.
+
. **Publish the content** from Content Studio by selecting the site, and then `Publish Tree` from the top right menu.
. Your site should now be live and kicking
+
Congratulations, you have just created a Next.js site powered by Enonic - go have some fun with it!
